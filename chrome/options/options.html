    <h3 id="warning">Why clips have warning if they don't have a vod:</h3>
        <p>
        LookingGlass runs on timestamps. It grabs the current timestamp and then scans through a user's VODs to find that time. 
        But if a clip doesn't have a VOD attached, LG can't nail down the exact timestamp because the VOD start time is the only precise reference point. 
        So, LG uses the time of when the clip was created and subtracts 30 seconds as a rough estimation. This works around 98% of the time, but there are two main failure modes:<br>
        1. If a mobile user creates a clip while live delayed by 10 minutes and the VOD never gets published, all the links generated will be 10 minutes behind.<br>
        2. If someone creates a clip from a VOD hours after the event happened, and then that VOD later gets deleted, the links will be hours off from the intended timestamp.
        </p>
    <h3 id="problems">Problems or suggestions?</h3>
    LookingGlass should now be more reliable than before, but it can still break. 
    It uses Twitch and Kick's tags to embed itself into the page, so the extension may fail to load if that site modifies the tags it's trying to embed on. 
    If you notice a problem, you can check the GitHub issues tab to see if it has been reported yet, and you can open a new issue if not. 
    If you prefer not to use GitHub, it's totally fine to email me directly. You can find my email on both web store pages. 
    Links to the GitHub repository and web stores are at the top right of this page. <br><br>
    Don't hesitate to email any and all feedback - Positive/negative/ideas/concerns send em over because I rarely hear from people, 
    and it's hard to get a sense of how people are generally liking the extension. I always appreciate getting feedback! Thanks!
